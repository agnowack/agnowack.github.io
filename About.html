<br> <p>A little about me&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&nbsp;<br>
<p>&nbsp; I became interested in the IT field when a family friend asked if I would like to work with his IT company, performing small tasks as needed.<br>
 I was extremely excited about the opportunity and immediately agreed to spend as much of my time there as he would allow. I started out with small tasks <br>
like reimaging company computers and eventually I began going to client sites. It was a thrill to help set everything up and learn just how much is involved in<br>
 providing technology related services. For instance once of the clients that I helped service is a Montessori school, I was amazed at the amount of IT infastructure<br>
 that is involved in running a school.It was a great way to get introduced to the field of IT.
<br>


One of the things that I believe is most important in life, is to always keep moving forward. I am working toward getting an AAS degree in Cybersecurity<br>
My plan is dual enrollment using homeschool and Wake Tech (Go Eagles!). I hope to earn useful certificates for IT such as the CompTIAF+. <br>
			

One of my current focuses is setting up a proper website to increase traffic flow. An influx of diverse traffic leading to diverse projects will allow me more experience<br>
 and enhance my skills, making me more valuable to the marketplace. In the future one of the services I will offer will be designing and setting up websites tailored to any need<br>
 one may have. <br>
